### FEATURES EXPLAINED

## Add/Remove an Employee:
The website provides the ability to add and remove employees. You can add new employees by clicking on the 'ADD' button and providing the necessary details such as name, email, and position. Removing an employee can be done by pressing the 'x' icon next to their name in the 'Current Employees' list.
## Current Employees:
The website maintains a list of current employees, which includes the employees that have been added using the 'ADD' button. The 'Current Employees' list is displayed below the input fields and is updated dynamically as employees are added or removed.
## Clear All:
To clear all the input fields, you can simply press the 'Clear All' button. This action removes the text entered in the name, email, and position fields, but does not affect the 'Current Employees' list.
## Delete Employee:
To remove a specific employee from the 'Current Employees' list, you can click on the 'x' icon next to their name. The list will update automatically to reflect the removal of the employee.
## Fully Responsive:
The website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. Whether you access the website on a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile device, the layout and content will adapt to ensure readability and usability.
